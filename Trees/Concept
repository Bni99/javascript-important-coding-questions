So basically a tree is binary when it can max have 2 children 
a leaf is a node with no children
ancestor would be a parent or before generations

5 type of binary tree
Full binary tree 
so either a node have zero or 2 children

complete binary tree
all the levels completely filled except the last level and in the last level also the nodes should in as left as possible

perfect binary tree
all the leaf nodes should be at same level

balanced tree 
at max the height of tree is log to the base 2 n , where n is the number of nodes 

degenerate tree
where every node has one children

for binary search tree
the data in the left node is < or equal to the parent node and in right node its > than parent
